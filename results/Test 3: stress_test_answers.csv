### Answer: The function in Lamini that terminates a running job by sending a request to the server, releasing any resources used, and returning a response indicating the cancellation's success or failure is terminate_job. 

Refer to the Lamini documentation for more information. "
" 
### Answer: 2. get_job_status 

The function get_job_status in Lamini offers real-time updates on the status of a job, including its progress, completion, or failure, and may provide additional details such as timestamps and error messages. "

### Answer: 1. filter_fn is the parameter that allows for custom filtering of generated output based on a provided function.  It is a function that takes in a generated output and returns a filtered output based on the provided criteria.  This allows for fine-grained control over the generated output and ensures that it meets the specific requirements of the task at hand.  By defining a custom filtering function using the filter_fn parameter, developers can ensure that the generated output"

### Answer: The parameter in Lamini that limits the number of retries in case the generated output does not satisfy a specified condition is retry_threshold. 
Lamini's retry_threshold parameter is used to control the number of retries that Lamini will make when generating text that does not satisfy a specified condition. The parameter takes an integer value, and when the number of retries exceeds this value, Lamini will stop making retries"

### Answer: The parameter in Lamini that controls the maximum length of generated text outputs is text_length_limit. This parameter allows for precise control over text length, allowing developers to set the maximum number of tokens or characters that can be generated in a single output. By setting this parameter, developers can ensure that generated text is concise and well-structured, while also controlling the overall length of the output.
